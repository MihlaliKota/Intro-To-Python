## Python 101: Introduction to Python

### How Computers Work
----------------------

Computers process information in a complex manner that involves storing files and data in memory. The memory acts as a grid where files are stored, each with a file name and associated information like size. Accessing file contents involves the computer following pointers, which are addresses indicating where the file contents are located in memory.

- How Computers Think

Interacting with a computer program means engaging with its memory. Programs create variables, akin to mini files, with names and addresses pointing to specific memory locations. For instance, in a program like A = 2, B = 3, C = A + B, the computer generates variables A and B, pointing to values 2 and 3 in memory. It then calculates A plus B, storing the result in variable C.

- Simple Program

Consider the following scenario: A represents a list of numbers in Python, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. When we assign B to A, B essentially refers to the same memory location as A.

This linkage means that any alterations made to A will also impact B. For example, if we change the value of 1 in A to 6, B will reflect the same modification. Understanding this concept of memory assignment is vital in programming, as it involves direct manipulation of the computer's memory for inputting, retrieving, and altering data. Hence, comprehending the underlying processes is crucial.

- Altered List Program

Understanding the inner workings of computers when executing programs is crucial, particularly in handling complex programs. When assigning one variable to another, rather than creating a copy, both variables point to the same memory location. Therefore, modifications to one variable will impact the other. This understanding is fundamental when programming and manipulating data in computer memory.

### Zen of Python
-----------------

Python has gained popularity over its three-decade existence, contrasting with the perceived clumsiness of JavaScript. Python is celebrated for its elegance, offering a modern language experience. Its syntax promotes consistency, ensuring similarity in calling functions. Developers deliberately maintained Python's simplicity and coherence, catering not only to beginners but also to complex system development. Python excels in managing intricate scenarios, aligning with its ethos encapsulated in the "import this" mission statement.

- Starting up Python in a terminal

To enter the Python command prompt, launch a terminal and input "Python." Upon opening, you'll notice three greater-than symbols, signaling that the prompt awaits Python code input.

- Running the “import this” statement

To continue, enter "import this" command. Here, "import" retrieves a module for use, and "this" denotes the module we're fetching. We'll delve deeper into import statements later, but for now, input "import this" at the command prompt to print the document.

### Variables and Types
-----------------------

The fundamental element of a program is termed a variable, which receives a value using the equal sign as an assignment operator. In Jupyter Notebooks, cells are executed with Shift + Enter, and a new cell can be added by clicking outside the margin and typing 'a'. Variables cannot begin with numbers, but they can contain uppercase and lowercase letters along with underscores. Conventionally, variable names in Python start with lowercase letters.

- Introduction to Variables

Python encompasses various variable types: integers for whole numbers, floats for decimals, complex numbers for intricate math, strings for character collections, and Booleans for true/false values. Concatenating strings employs the plus sign, though it's not viable for mixing strings and numbers. Error messages furnish valuable insights during Python operations.

### Data Structures
-------------------

Python's data structures enable bundling multiple values within one variable. The initial structure explored is a list, capable of holding various data types, even lists within lists. List length is assessable via the length function. Sets, resembling lists but comprising only distinct elements, are initiated with curly braces.

- Introduction to Data Structures

Sets don't retain element order, unlike lists. Tuples resemble lists but are immutable once defined. They're beneficial for storing data efficiently, like coordinate pairs. Dictionaries consist of key-value pairs akin to a word-definition pair. Declared with curly braces, dictionaries are accessed via keys.
